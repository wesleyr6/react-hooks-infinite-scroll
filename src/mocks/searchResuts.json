My wife went over it with her bike and was in a horrible accident and had to be rushed to the hospital. She has a badly sprained right wrist, a mildly sprained left wrist, horrible bruising on her arms, shoulder, and knee. It seems there has been utility work done and the patch job to the road was done incorrectly and has completely caved it. This is absolutely unacceptable. Had this been a child, the outcome could have been a lot worse.",
